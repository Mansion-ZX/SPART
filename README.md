# SPART - SPAcecraft Robotics Toolkit

SPART is a MATLAB/SIMULINK open-source modeling and control toolkit for orbiting spacecraft with robotic arms (i.e floating base robots).

SPART is organized as a collection of MATLAB functions and Simulink blocks. These can be used to built plants, forward or inverse dynamic solvers and controllers.

## Installation

Just copy the toolkit and in Matlab run the `SPART2path`. This will add all the SPART functions and Simulink library to the path and save it. Then you can use it as any other toolbox.

## Usage

Check the documentation [here](http://spart.readthedocs.org).
Additionally some examples of their usage can be found in the `Examples` folder that illustrate the basic functionality of the toolkit.
