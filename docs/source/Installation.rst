Installing SPART
================

First you need to download the SPART toolkit from the `SPART Github repository <https://github.com/NPS-SRL/SPART/archive/master.zip>`_ or

.. code:: sh

 git clone https://github.com/NPS-SRL/SPART.git

Once you have the code just put it wherever you like and execute the following command in the MATLAB command window:

.. code:: matlab
	
	SPART2path

This will add all the required SPART folders into your MATLAB path and save it.
